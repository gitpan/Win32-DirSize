Win32/DirSize version 0.01
==========================

This module is written in 100% pure perl.  It requires only Win32::API to run.
The best method to install is with nmake, but if you don't have that, you can
copy the DirSize.pm file under perl\site\lib\Win32.

In General, Win32::DirSize is 2-8x faster than calculating sizes via File::Find.

Look for a future version of Win32::DirSize which will be utilize XS instead of
Win32::API for enhanced performance.
