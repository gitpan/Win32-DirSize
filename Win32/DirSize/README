Win32/DirSize version 1.10
==========================

This module is written using C / XS.  It does not require any other modules,
but you will need a C compiler to build it.  If you do not have a C compiler,
you can use the included PPM versions.

In my informal tests, this version of Win32::DirSize is 50x faster than 
calculating sizes via File::Find.

INSTALLATION

To compile this module from source, type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   nmake
   nmake test
   nmake install

If you do not have a C compiler, you can use the PPM version:

   extract ppm.zip to a temporary folder
   run "ppm install Win32-DirSize.ppd" from the temporary folder

These instructions are for the newer versions of PPM.  YMMV.
